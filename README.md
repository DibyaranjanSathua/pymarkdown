How to run the code.
1. Clone the repository
2. cd to the root directory of the repository
3. Create a python3 venv (python3 -m venv venv)
4. source venv/bin/activate
5. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
6. ./main.py 

I have added a books.txt with only 3 product for testing. For product filename, use "./data/books.txt" as input.
